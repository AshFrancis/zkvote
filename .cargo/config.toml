# Cargo configuration for ZKVote Soroban contracts
#
# Protocol 25 requires wasm32v1-none target for BN254 pairing and Poseidon hash support.
#
# Build contracts:   cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
# Run tests:         cargo test --workspace
#
# Note: Do NOT set a default target here as it breaks cargo test.
